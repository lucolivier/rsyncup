# Rsyncup run once a day to execute backup sets required according to their frequency. Backup sets may
# be run daily, weekly, monthly or in demand with a dedicated triger. Destination of Backup may be
# unique (defined as global thru symbol) or specified at Backup set level in the same way as some params.
#
# Parameters are structured in two major parts: General and Backup Sets. General part is divided in 3
# sections: Processing, Destination and Report.
#
#
# General Params
# ==============
#
# Processing section
# ------------------
#
# BackupWeekDay:		[N] Day of Week to perform weekly backup sets (Monday=1) for backup set using
#						frequency param 'W' alone.

BackupWeekDay '7'

# BackupMonthDay:		[NN] Day of month to perform monthly backup sets for backup set using frequency
# 						param 'M' alone. Avoid 27 to 31 in order to ensure a true monthly backup). Format
#						is led on 2 digits. Eg: 01, 09, 23...

BackupMonthDay '1'

# BackupSemFileName:	File name for triggered backup with semaphore file placed at root backup sets
#						source path.

BackupSemFileName '--BACKUP--'

# TempFolder:			The path to the folder where are temporarily stored compressed data before
#						transfers. The temp storage must be large as the whole backup sets size.
#						For security reason final path endded with rsyncup name.

TempFolder '/var/tmp/rsyncup_tmp'


# Destination Section
# --------------
#
# [RsyncServer]:		Optional param. It takes place as symbol (global) in order to don't have need
#						to specify it literally in backup set. It's typically made for backup to a unique
#						store.
#						Syntax is [rsync server ip or fqdn address:[port]:group].
#						eg: backup.domain.com:873:WEBSERVER1
#						Rsync Server IP or FQDN to which are sent data. Port may be use to specify
#						a different port as default (843). Group is the name of declared rsync server
#						store where send data.

#RsyncServer '212.198.216.89::TEST'

# [HelperPort]:			Optional param. Like RsyncServer param it takes place as symbol (global) for
#						backupsets usage. rsyncup-helper port to get storage stats and send commands
#						to rsyncup server side.

#HelperPort '874'

# [StoragePath]:		Optional param. It takes place as symbol (global) like RsyncServer param.
#						If RsyncServer is defined, path must be relative while if not, path must be
#						absolute.

#StoragePath '/'
#StoragePath '/TEST'
StoragePath '/Development/Production/rsyncup/rsyncup GitHub/lab/data-bkp'

# Report Section
# --------------

# LogPathFolder:		Folder wherein are stored folder containing process report files.
#						For security reason final path endded with rsyncup name.

#LogPathFolder '/var/log'
LogPathFolder '/Development/Production/rsyncup/rsyncup GitHub/lab/log'

# [MailToReport]:		Optional param. Email address(es) to which send emailed reports. Separate adresses
#                       with comma.

#MailToReport 'admin@nova.asity.fr'

# [MailFromReport]:		Optional param. Email from address for emailed reports. Not supported on Darwin.

MailFromReport 'admin@asity.fr'

# [MailSubjectReport]:	Subject of emailed reports.

MailSubjectReport 'TEST_Backup_Report'

#						Usage statistic general concern
#						-------------------------------
#						Whatever above next params are defined or not, statistics are always calculated
#						when it's possible.
#						These params are only used to generate level alerts.
#
# [StoreVolMax]			Optional param. Act as symbol in backupsets. StoreVolMax defines the max level
#						usage in percent of group disk partition in order to alert before reach near
#						capacity storage. Syntax is '##' or '##%'
#						If backup is made on server, helper have to run server side in order to transmit
#						these information. If backup is local these values are self evaluated.
#						If this param and storage global params (RsyncServer and/or StoragePath) defined
#						stats will be calculated before backup sets excutions.

#StoreVolMax '20%'

# [StoreGroupMax]: 		Optional param. Act as symbol in backupsets. StoreGroupMax defines the size max
#						in (M)ega, (G)iga or (T)era of group from with alert.
#						As StorageVolMax regarding local or remote condition of execution.
#						As StoreVolMax, if this param and storage global params (RsyncServer and/or
#						StoragePath) defined stats will be calculated before backup sets excutions.

#StoreGroupMax "1G"


# Backup Set Params
# ==============
#
# Backup set are defined standardly with a NAME of set, a SOURCE FILES and/or a LOCAL DATABASE running under
# mysql, an optional SERVER, a DESTINATION PATH remote or local, a FRENQUENCY and a BACKUP KIND.
# A backup set is delimited start with "BackupSet(" and endded by a ")". Some parameters may be specified
# to refer to global symbol with the word 'global'. Some complementary options may be added at backup set
# level.
#
#BackupSet(
#
#	[Name]				Set Name - Optional param
#						eg: DOMAIN.COM
#						If not specified become basename of files path or db name.
#						If many set wear the same name they'll be renamed with numered suffix.
#
#	[Files]				Absolute local path - Optional param
#						eg: /home/domain
#						The path must exists.
#						May be skipped to perform a DB backup only.
#
#	[DB]				MySQL database parameters - Optional param
#						Syntax: dbname:account:password
#						eg: domaindb:nicky:foobar
#						dbname defines the database to backup. Account and password define credits
#						to process data dump. Data are backup-ed in SQL format.
#						May be skipped to perform a Files backup only.
#						! if nor Files nor DB is specified BackupSet is skipped.
#
#	[Server]			Address to rsync server and path - Optional param
#						Syntax: address:[port]:group | global
#						eg: bkpserver.domain.com:786:WebServer1 | global
#						See global param RsyncServer for further explanation of rsync url structure.
#						If defined as 'global' the RsyncServer param must be set otherwise backup set is
#						skipped. If skipped, backup is assumed as local.
#
#	[HelperPort]		Helper port on server - Optional param
#						Syntax: port | global
#						eg: 378
#						See global param HelperPort for further explanation.
#						If skipped no remote stat, archives or backup suffixed files purges or suffixe
#						rotation are processed.
#
#	[StoragePath]		Absolute path of local or Relative path in Server Group - Optional param
#						Syntax: path | global | global/path
#		 				eg: /backup/domain | websites/domain
#						Depending if backup is remote or local path must have or not an heading slash.
#						In case of missing, backup set is skiped to avoid risky operation.
#						May be skipped only for remote backup. If backup is Nested (N) the destination path
#						is assumed by rsync server depending on source path. If backup is Archive (C) the
#						void path is corrected. In the 2 cases, the final path come as basename of Files.
#																							
#	Frequency			Periodicity of backup execution
#						Syntax: D | W[:Nbr] | M[:Nbr] | T
#						eg: D | W:5 | M:15
#						See global params: BackupWeekDay and BackupMonthDay
#						Weekly and Montly frenquencies may receive a specified param as day of week or
#						month in order to bypass global param.
#						With 'T' backup set is exclusively processed thru file triger. Whatever
#						the Frequency setting, triger file forces backup set execution.
#																							
#	Method				Method of backup.
#						Syntax: C[:WMY|MY|Y] | N[:D|B[:Nbr]]
#						eg: C | C:MY | N | N:D | N:B | N:B:15
#						Backup are processed according 2 methods: as compressed archive (tgz) or as nested
#						directory (the whole hierarchy of folders and files).
#						Basically compressed backup stores a new archive at each backup set execution and
#						nested backup updates nested hierarchy folder server side without deleting disappeared
#						files or folders from source. But fine tuning may be specified for both.
#						These options needs rsyncup-server and rsyncup-helper remotely.
#						Locally they are performed directly by rsyncup.
#						C stands for compressed archives at each backup set execution.
#						C:WMY|MY|Y stands for get lost some of backup-ed archives regarding 3 kinds
#						of behaviors, in order to keep safe some space on storage.
#						'WMY' keeps daily-ed in week, weedly-ed in current month, then monthly-ed in year,
#						then yearly-ed.
#						'MY' keeps daily-ed in month, then monthly-ed, then yearly-ed.
#						'Y' keeps daily-ed in year, then yearly-ed.
#						N stands for nested backup ignoring disappeared folders and files from source
#						into backup-ed nested hierarchy.
#						N:D stands for delete disappeared folder and file — acts as mirroring.
#						N:B stands for preserve files backup side when source files have changed.
#						Files are added with the suffix '______BKP####' incremented by 1 at each
#						change — the last is numbered '______BKP0001'.
#						N:B:Nbr stands for keep a defined amount of backup suffixed files.
#
#						Report general concern
#						----------------------
#						Report by backup set means dedicated report for one set not for general backup
#						concern.
#						
#	[ReportPath]		Absolute or relative path to dedicated report folder - Optional param
#						eg: /home/logs | backups/logs
#						May be skipped.
#						Relative path is based on Files path param if exists. If not, report is skipped.
#						The second to last directory of then absolute or final path of relative must exists.
#						For security reason while final path is endded with rsyncup name.
#
#	[ReportMail]		Dedicate report Email information - Optional param
#						Email report is based on dedicated template to inform user of execution, path
#						to consult log (if ReportPath is defined) and explanation for backup trigger.
#						May be skipped.
#
#						Usage Statistics general concern
#						--------------------------------
#						If backup is remote, rsyncup-helper is needed to proceed fixed by 'HelperPort'
#						param.
#						
#						If the given level is over this doosn't stop backup execution.
#						Stats are calculated for each of the next defined params, before and after
#						the backup in order to facilitate the comparison. If none of them are defined
#						stats are not calculted even tough the HelperPort param is set.
#
#
#	[StoreVolMax]		Percentage of usage of partition storage from which alert - Optional param
#						Syntax: ##% or ## | global
#						eg: 50% or 50
#						See global StoreVolMax param for further information. 'global' symbol may
#						be used instead of a specified amount.
#
#	[StoreGroupMax]		Size of remote storage group from which alert - Optional param
#						Syntax: ###M|G|T | global
#						eg: 167G
#						Must be used only for remote storage while group notion doesn't exist locally.
#						See global StoreGroupMax param for further information. 'global' symbol may
#						be used instead of a specified amount.
#						
#	[StoreSetMax]		Size from which alert - Optional param
#						Syntax: as StoreGroupMax
#						If backup is remote, rsyncup-helper is needed to be performed.
#						Alert if set storage grows over the defined value.
